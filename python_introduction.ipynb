    "# Python: Introduction\n",
    "Data science is like painting. Your canvas is your dataset, your statistical techniques are your colors, and your technique and artistry comes through your programming. Data scientists with strong programming skills are able to quickly implement techniques and are more readily able to be more creative problem solvers and scientists. This module will guide you through the basics of programming with Python with an eye towards the most important components you'll need to work with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do I learn to program?\n",
    "One of the most important skills you can develop is learning to learn. While this course provides the pathway to greater understanding, it requires engagement and facing desirable difficulties of not always knowing exactly what to do to learn how to solve problems programmatically. Reading every textbook and watching every video on programming will not, alone, develop your skills. Becoming good at programming is much like becoming good at any spoken language. You will only develop your skills by hands-on experience using the language. This process will be hard at times, and you'll sometimes feel like you're struggling to understand a concept or fix a bug. That's natural and that's often when you learn the most. Here are some tips for success:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Embrace effort**. Always work through all the examples until the end - don't stop and assume that you could figure out the rest. Sometimes this struggle is uncomfortable, but know that it's through that struggle that you'll learn the most, and that's a good thing! Numerous research studies have lauded \"desirable difficulties\" in the learning process. \n",
    "2. **When you get stuck, search**. If you get stuck - search or an answer yourself and you'll be surprised how many times there's someone who has already answered your question as the internet is awash with resources for answering targeted questions. Every time I go to code something that I haven't done before, I inevitably end up looking on one of a number of websites / forums such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/), [Quora](https://www.quora.com/), or a host of other sites that are best found through a Google search of your topic. A key skill to develop is knowing when to trust a source and when to keep looking.\n",
    "3. **When in doubt, draw it out**. When you're trying to accomplish something algorithmically, think through and draw out (on paper) the logic that you're trying to implement before typing in code. You'll be extremely surprised how many times you'll realize a flaw in your logic or something you missed when you get it down on a page."

    "## Why use Python?\n",
    "There are many computer languages out there, of which Python is one. The most popular languages are Java and C/C++, known for their platform portability (Java) and speed (C). However, for working with data, the two dominant languages today are Python and R. You'll be exposed to R in the statistics module of this online review, but in this module, Python is the focus. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous strengths of this language, which have helped to propel it to becoming one of the most popular languages for data science:\n",
    "1. **Readability**. Python is considered to be by many more naturally readable than other languages.\n",
    "2. **Scientific programming**. With packages like `NumPy` (efficient numerical computing), `SciPy` (optimization, linear algebra, integration, and much more), `matplotlib` (plotting), `StatsModels` (statistics), and `scikit-learn` (machine learning), Python is well-equipped to handly nearly any scientific programming challeng \n",
    "3. **Object oriented**. From the ground up, Python is object oriented, with all of the primary data types being objects. We'll expore what objects are and their benefits in later units, but their benefits including making the code more modular, testable, extensible, maintainable, and reusable.\n",
    "4. **Free**. Python is free and open source. Enough said.\n",
    "5. **Portable**. Python works on nearly all systems including Macs, Unix, Linux, and Windows.\n",
    "6. **Easy to use and learn**. Due to the language's readbility and clean syntax, you can often get what you want done in many fewer steps than with C, C++, or Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest weaknesses of Python is it's performance. Python is slower than compiled languages like C. However, as more packages are developed that extend Python, efficient C-based modules are bring some of that efficiency to the language. We'll see this in detail when we talk about vectorization with `NumPy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about R? R is a programming language written by statisticians to meet their needs; Python was developed by computer scientists as a robust programming language that also is very good at statistics through modules that have been developed. For many applications, either Python or R will get the job done, and both are worth knowing for the aspiring data scientist, and you'll encounter R as you explore statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python, however, consistently pulls ahead in numerous ranking for both the data science community, particularly within the subfield of machine learning, as well as the broader programming community. Python has the benefit of being a popular programming language used across many industries, not only for data science. The [Kaggle State of Data Science Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/surveys/2017), conducted by the preeminant host of online machine learning competitions, rated Python as the most used programming language of of data science professionals. Additionally, those same professionals overwhelmingly recommend Python as the language for new data scientists to learn first. The ratings don't end there. The [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) ranked Python](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-2017-top-programming-languages) as the #1 programming language in 2017. In the [TIOBE software index for 2018 ranks Python](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) (shown below), Python is the number 4 programming language just after Java, C, and C++, the dominant languages in industry. Just being in the same league as those industry standards demonstrates that Python is a highly transferrable skill that can help to propel your career in diverse directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/tiobe.png\" width=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fun fact: why is it called Python?\n",
    "Contrary to popular belief, the Python programming language was not named after a snake, but instead, the creater of Python, Guido van Rossum, was rading the scripts to the show \"Monty Python's Flying Circus,\" a BBC comedy series from the 1970's with many iconic sketches. This provided the inspiration for the name."

    "## Interpreted language vs compiled languages\n",
    "*Section from Charles R. Severance, \"Python for Everybody\" [Chapter 1](https://www.py4e.com/html3/01-intro)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level language intended to be relatively straightforward for humans to read and write and for computers to read and process. Other high-level languages include Java, C++, PHP, Ruby, Basic, Perl, JavaScript, and many more. The actual hardware inside the Central Processing Unit (CPU) does not understand any of these high-level languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CPU understands a language we call machine language. Machine language is very simple and frankly very tiresome to write because it is represented all in zeros and ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "001010001110100100101010000001111\n",
    "11100110000011101010010101101101\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine language seems quite simple on the surface, given that there are only zeros and ones, but its syntax is even more complex and far more intricate than Python. So very few programmers ever write machine language. Instead we build various translators to allow programmers to write in high-level languages like Python or JavaScript and these translators convert the programs to machine language for actual execution by the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since machine language is tied to the computer hardware, machine language is not portable across different types of hardware. Programs written in high-level languages can be moved between different computers by using a different interpreter on the new machine or recompiling the code to create a machine language version of the program for the new machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "These programming language translators fall into two general categories: (1) interpreters and (2) compilers.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interpreter reads the source code of the program as written by the programmer, parses the source code, and interprets the instructions on the fly. Python is an interpreter and when we are running Python interactively, we can type a line of Python and Python processes it immediately and is ready for us to type another line of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the lines of Python tell Python that you want it to remember some value for later. We need to pick a name for that value to be remembered and we can use that symbolic name to retrieve the value later. We use the term variable to refer to the labels we use to refer to this stored data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    >>> x = 6\n",
    "    >>> print(x)\n",
    "    6\n",
    "    >>> y = x * 7\n",
    "    >>> print(y)\n",
    "    42\n",
    "    >>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we ask Python to remember the value six and use the label `x` so we can retrieve the value later. We verify that Python has actually remembered the value using print. Then we ask Python to retrieve `x` and multiply it by seven and put the newly computed value in `y`. Then we ask Python to print out the value currently in `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though we are typing these commands into Python one line at a time, Python is treating them as an ordered sequence of statements with later statements able to retrieve data created in earlier statements. We are writing our first simple programming paragraph with four sentences in a logical and meaningful order.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the nature of an interpreter to be able to have an interactive conversation as shown above. A compiler needs to be handed the entire program in a file, and then it runs a process to translate the high-level source code into machine language and then the compiler puts the resulting machine language into a file for later execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a Windows system, often these executable machine language programs have a suffix of \".exe\" or \".dll\" which stand for \"executable\" and \"dynamic link library\" respectively. In Linux and Macintosh, there is no suffix that uniquely marks a file as executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were to open an executable file in a text editor, it would look completely crazy and be unreadable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "^?ELF^A^A^A^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^B^@^C^@^A^@^@^@\\xa0\\x82\n",
    "^D^H4^@^@^@\\x90^]^@^@^@^@^@^@4^@ ^@^G^@(^@$^@!^@^F^@\n",
    "^@^@4^@^@^@4\\x80^D^H4\\x80^D^H\\xe0^@^@^@\\xe0^@^@^@^E\n",
    "^@^@^@^D^@^@^@^C^@^@^@^T^A^@^@^T\\x81^D^H^T\\x81^D^H^S\n",
    "^@^@^@^S^@^@^@^D^@^@^@^A^@^@^@^A\\^D^HQVhT\\x83^D^H\\xe8\n",
    "....\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not easy to read or write machine language, so it is nice that we have interpreters and compilers that allow us to write in high-level languages like Python or C.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now at this point in our discussion of compilers and interpreters, you should be wondering a bit about the Python interpreter itself. What language is it written in? Is it written in a compiled language? When we type \"python\", what exactly is happening?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python interpreter is written in a high-level language called \"C\". You can look at the actual source code for the Python interpreter by going to www.python.org and working your way to their source code. So Python is a program itself and it is compiled into machine code. When you installed Python on your computer (or the vendor installed it), you copied a machine-code copy of the translated Python program onto your system. In Windows, the executable machine code for Python itself is likely in a file with a name like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "C:\\Python36\\python.exe\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That is more than you really need to know to be a Python programmer, but sometimes it pays to answer those little nagging questions right at the beginning."
