You can use numbers in variable names, but they just can't begin the name. So `miles1000` is legal syntax. You can use letters, numbers, and underscores, but not other symbols. Therefore, `eat@joes` is not a valid name.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll talk more about style later, but generally, you'll want to make these variable names meaningful. Let's say you were trying to represent the speed of a train. You could use a variable `s`, but there are a lot of things that could mean. A better (and more descriptive) name would be `speed`, and better still would be `speed_of_train`. Now, you want this to be within a reasonable length, so `speed_of_train_from_boston_to_new_york_through_new_haven_and_providence` is not an ideal name because it's far too long. Use common sense and above all, make your code readable so someone else could easily pick it up, understand it, and use it.\n",
