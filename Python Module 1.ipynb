    "# Module 1: Foundations of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science is like painting. Your canvas is your dataset, your statistical techniques are your colors, and your technique and artistry is your programming. Data scientists with strong programming skills are able to quickly implement techniques and are more readily able to be more creative problem solvers and scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives of Module 1\n",
    "By the end of this module, you will be able to...\n",
    "1. Articulate the strengths and weaknesses of using Python vs other tools such as R\n",
    "2. Explain the differences between the command line, Ipython, Jupyter Notebooks, and the Spyder IDE and when to use each.\n",
    "3. Create variables and use those variables in basic scripts that contain conditional statements and loops\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use these modules\n",
    "While the content in each of these modules covers the material at a high level, there is significant depth provided through associated readings and videos throughout the course. While the topics are designed to be complementary, a number of key topics are addressed in both to provide multiple perspectives. Wherever you see a \\*\\*\\*Reading\\*\\*\\* section, this is a required course component, so please open the link and read the content. The videos may also help if you're struggling with any of the particular topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this module, the references used are from Charles Severance, [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/lessons), who provides an excellent overview of these topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use Python?\n",
    "There are numerous strengths of this language, which have helped to propel it to becoming one of the most popular languages for data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths of Python:\n",
    "1. Readability. Python is considered to be by many more naturally readable than other languages.\n",
    "2. Numeric and scientific programming (with packages like numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn)\n",
    "3. Object oriented. From the ground up, Python is object oriented, with all of the primary data types being objects. We'll expore the benefits of this in later modules, but they are considerable.\n",
    "4. Free. Enough said.\n",
    "5. Portable. Python works on nearly all systems.\n",
    "6. Easy to use and easier to learn\n",
    "7. Provides the simplicity and ease of use of a interpreted language with the advanced tools that are found in compiled languages (dynamic typing, automatic memory management)\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses of Python:\n",
    "1. Performance - Python is slower than compiled languages like C.\n",
    "2. It can be challenging to manage python packages and confusion exists between code bases written in Python 2 vs Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about R? \"R is a programming language developed by statisticians for statisticians; Python was developed by a computer scientist, and it can be used by programmers to apply statistical techniques.\" R does statistics extremely well and is an extremely powerful tool for data science, well-worth knowing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has the benefit of being independently an extremely powerful programming language used in many industries, not only for data science. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) ranked Python as the #1 programming language in 2017. This is a highly transferrable skill that can help to propel your career in many different directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I learn to program?\n",
    "True or false: if I read enough textbooks and watch enough videos about programming, I'll become a good programmer. This statement could not be more FALSE. Becoming good at programming is much like becoming good at any spoken language. You will only develop your skills by hands-on experience using the language. This process will be hard at times, and you'll sometimes feel like you're struggling to understand a concept or fix a bug. That's natural and that's often when you learn the most. Here are some tips for success:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Always work through all the examples until the end - don't stop and assume that you could figure out the rest.\n",
    "2. If you get stuck - search or an answer. Every time I go to code something that I haven't done before, I inevitably end up looking on one of a number of websites / forums such as Stack Overflow, StackExchange, Quora, or a host of other sites that are best found through a general Google search of your topic. A key skill to develop is knowing when to trust a source and when to keep looking.\n",
    "3. When in doubt, draw it. When you're trying to accomplish something algorithmically, think through and draw out the logic that you're trying to implement before typing in code.\n",

    "### Interpreted language vs compiled languages\n",
    "*Section from Charles R. Severance, \"Python for Everybody\" [Chapter 1](https://www.py4e.com/html3/01-intro)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level language intended to be relatively straightforward for humans to read and write and for computers to read and process. Other high-level languages include Java, C++, PHP, Ruby, Basic, Perl, JavaScript, and many more. The actual hardware inside the Central Processing Unit (CPU) does not understand any of these high-level languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CPU understands a language we call machine language. Machine language is very simple and frankly very tiresome to write because it is represented all in zeros and ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "001010001110100100101010000001111\n",
    "11100110000011101010010101101101\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine language seems quite simple on the surface, given that there are only zeros and ones, but its syntax is even more complex and far more intricate than Python. So very few programmers ever write machine language. Instead we build various translators to allow programmers to write in high-level languages like Python or JavaScript and these translators convert the programs to machine language for actual execution by the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since machine language is tied to the computer hardware, machine language is not portable across different types of hardware. Programs written in high-level languages can be moved between different computers by using a different interpreter on the new machine or recompiling the code to create a machine language version of the program for the new machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "These programming language translators fall into two general categories: (1) interpreters and (2) compilers.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interpreter reads the source code of the program as written by the programmer, parses the source code, and interprets the instructions on the fly. Python is an interpreter and when we are running Python interactively, we can type a line of Python (a sentence) and Python processes it immediately and is ready for us to type another line of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the lines of Python tell Python that you want it to remember some value for later. We need to pick a name for that value to be remembered and we can use that symbolic name to retrieve the value later. We use the term variable to refer to the labels we use to refer to this stored data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    >>> x = 6\n",
    "    >>> print(x)\n",
    "    6\n",
    "    >>> y = x * 7\n",
    "    >>> print(y)\n",
    "    42\n",
    "    >>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we ask Python to remember the value six and use the label x so we can retrieve the value later. We verify that Python has actually remembered the value using print. Then we ask Python to retrieve x and multiply it by seven and put the newly computed value in y. Then we ask Python to print out the value currently in y.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though we are typing these commands into Python one line at a time, Python is treating them as an ordered sequence of statements with later statements able to retrieve data created in earlier statements. We are writing our first simple paragraph with four sentences in a logical and meaningful order.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the nature of an interpreter to be able to have an interactive conversation as shown above. A compiler needs to be handed the entire program in a file, and then it runs a process to translate the high-level source code into machine language and then the compiler puts the resulting machine language into a file for later execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a Windows system, often these executable machine language programs have a suffix of \".exe\" or \".dll\" which stand for \"executable\" and \"dynamic link library\" respectively. In Linux and Macintosh, there is no suffix that uniquely marks a file as executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were to open an executable file in a text editor, it would look completely crazy and be unreadable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "^?ELF^A^A^A^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^B^@^C^@^A^@^@^@\\xa0\\x82\n",
    "^D^H4^@^@^@\\x90^]^@^@^@^@^@^@4^@ ^@^G^@(^@$^@!^@^F^@\n",

    "^@^@^@^S^@^@^@^D^@^@^@^A^@^@^@^A\\^D^HQVhT\\x83^D^H\\xe8\n",
    "....\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not easy to read or write machine language, so it is nice that we have interpreters and compilers that allow us to write in high-level languages like Python or C.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now at this point in our discussion of compilers and interpreters, you should be wondering a bit about the Python interpreter itself. What language is it written in? Is it written in a compiled language? When we type \"python\", what exactly is happening?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python interpreter is written in a high-level language called \"C\". You can look at the actual source code for the Python interpreter by going to www.python.org and working your way to their source code. So Python is a program itself and it is compiled into machine code. When you installed Python on your computer (or the vendor installed it), you copied a machine-code copy of the translated Python program onto your system. In Windows, the executable machine code for Python itself is likely in a file with a name like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "C:\\Python35\\python.exe\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "*Section adapted from Charles R. Severance, \"Python for Everybody\" [Chapter 1](https://www.py4e.com/html3/01-intro)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Typing commands into the Python interpreter is a great way to experiment with Python's features, but it is not recommended for solving more complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to write a program, we use a text editor to write the Python instructions into a file, which is called a script. By convention, Python scripts have names that end with .py.\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "print('Hello world!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To execute the script, you have to tell the Python interpreter the name of the file. In a Unix terminal (similar to Linux and MacOS terminal in terms of commands) or a Windows command window, you would type python hello.py as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python hello.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We call the Python interpreter and tell it to read its source code from the file \"hello.py\" instead of prompting us for lines of Python code interactively.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### What is a program?\n",
    "The definition of a program at its most basic is a sequence of Python statements that have been crafted to do something. Even our simple hello.py script is a program. It is a one-line program and is not particularly useful, but in the strictest definition, it is a Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might be easiest to understand what a program is by thinking about a problem that a program might be built to solve, and then looking at a program that would solve that problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets say you are doing Social Computing research on Facebook posts and you are interested in the most frequently used word in a series of posts. You could print out the stream of Facebook posts and pore over the text looking for the most common word, but that would take a long time and be very mistake prone. You would be smart to write a Python program to handle the task quickly and accurately so you can spend the weekend doing something fun.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, look at the following text about a clown and a car. Look at the text and figure out the most common word and how many times it occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "the clown ran after the car and the car ran into the tent\n",
    "and the tent fell down on the clown and the car\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then imagine that you are doing this task looking at millions of lines of text. Frankly it would be quicker for you to learn Python and write a Python program to count the words than it would be to manually scan the words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The even better news is that I already came up with a simple program to find the most common word in a text file. I wrote it, tested it, and now I am giving it to you to use so you can save some time.\n",

You simply type the code into a file called words.py and run it or you download the source code from http://www.py4e.com/code3/ and run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good example of how Python and the Python language are acting as an intermediary between you (the end user) and me (the programmer).

Therefore, eat@joes is not a valid name.\n",

You could use a variable `s`, but there are a lot of things that could mean. A better (and more descriptive) name would be `speed`, and better still would be `speed_of_train`. Now, you want this to be within a reasonable length, so `speed_of_train_from_boston_to_new_york_through_new_haven_and_providence` is not an ideal name because it's far too long.
