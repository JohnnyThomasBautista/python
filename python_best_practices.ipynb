    "Best practices... (this is completely raw, needs to be fleshed out)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Basics\n",
    "1. Use variables instead of hard coded numbers and place those variables at the top of your scripts and functions\n",
    "2. If you do something more than once – write a function for it\n",
    "3. Comment your code thoroughly\n",
    "    a. Include explanations of the purpose and overall design of your code.\n",
    "    b. Add comments to tricky parts of your code especially if it won’t be obvious to someone else\n",
    "    c. Document and comment your functions. Explain what the inputs and outputs are, how to use them, and the overall purpose of your code\n",
    "4. Use built in or pre-packaged functions when available – don’t always assume you have to start from scratch. Google it or check out the Matlab Central before you start coding up something complex\n",
    "5. Use the Matlab debugger to fix errors in your code\n",
    "6. Write scripts for each figure or set of figures you need to make so you can easily reproduce your results\n",
    "7. Use structures instead of feeding large numbers of parameters into a function; pass the structures to and from functions. This keeps the functions modular and the variables obvious. It also helps organize the variables.\n",
    "8. Optimize software only after it works correctly. Use Matlab’s Profiler to help optimize your code\n",
    "9. Make incremental changes. Work in small steps with frequent feedback and course correction.\n",
    "10. Plan for bugs and create test scripts and debugging tools liberally.\n",
    "11. Use a version control system. Recommendation: Git.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Naming Conventions: Variables, Functions, and Files\n",
    "12. Descriptive camel case variable names and function names OR underscores. Choose one and be consistent.\n",
    "    a. For camel case (e.g. camelCase)\n",
    "        i. Always start variables with lowercase then new words start with capital\n",
    "        ii. Acronyms are a word (e.g. signalSnr not signalSNR)\n",
    "    b. Distinguish structures by capitalizing the first letter\n",
    "        i. For camel case: FirstLetter instead of firstLetter \n",
    "        ii. For underscores: First_letter instead of first_letter\n",
    "    c. Distinguish constants by capitalizing all letters and using underscores (e.g. ALL_LETTERS)\n",
    "13. Loop variables have meaning and start with i* (or j*), e.g. iRow, iCol\n",
    "14. Length/size indicators start with n*: nRows, nCols\n",
    "15. Inside of a loop use c* to indicate the current value of something\n",
    "'''\n",
    "casesToConsider = cat(2,5:10,20:10:50);\n",
    "nCases = length(casesToConsider);\n",
    "for iCase = 1:nCases\n",
    "            cCase = casesToConsider(iCase);\n",
    "            ….\n",
    "end\n",
    "'''\n",
    "16.\tVariables with a large scope should have meaningful names, variables with a small scope can have short names\n",
    "17.\tAvoid using a keyword or special value name for a variable name\n",
    "18.\tA convention on pluralization should be followed consistently (always singular or always plural)\n",
    "19.\tNegated Boolean variable names should be avoided. Just like it’s poor grammar to use a double negative, it’s better to use isFound than ~isNotFound\n",
    "20.\tEnsure that all references to files are system independent. Use functions such as filesep, fullfile, and fileparts that create file paths (independent of the root folder of the computer or of whether the system is PC or Mac) so that all code is easily portable from one system to another.\n",
    "iofun_dir = ['toolbox' filesep 'matlab' filesep 'iofun']\n",
    "On Windows this produces:\t\ttoolbox\\matlab\\iofun\n",
    "On Mac / Unix systems this produces:\ttoolbox/matlab/iofun\n",
    "21.\tClasses: call all methods using dot notation rather than functional notation. For example:\n",
    "               returnedValue = object.methodName(args,...)\n",
    "instead of \treturnedValue = methodName(object,args,...)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhanced Code Readability\n",
    "22.\tFloating point constants should always be written with a digit before the decimal point: 0.5 not .5\n",
    "23.\tSurround operators (+, -, &, |, /, \\*, etc.) and equals signs with spaces: a + b not a+b\n",
    "24.\tCommas should be followed by a space: [1, 2, 344, 3] not [1,2,344,3]\n",
    "25.\tUse alignment of equals signs, spaces, and commas wherever it enhances readability, e.g.:\n",
    "'''\n",
    "     weightedPopulation = (doctorWeight * nDoctors) + ...\n",
    "                          (lawyerWeight * nLawyers) ;\n",
    "'''\n",
    "26.\tIn conditional statements (if, elseif, …, else, end) the most common case should come first and the exception in the else-part of an if-else-expression.\n",
    "27.\tComplex conditional expressions should be avoided. Introduce temporary logical variables instead.\n",
    "28.\tAny block of code appearing in more than one m-file should be considered for packaging as a fuction.\n",
    "29.\tAny function used by only one other function should be packaged as its subfunction in the same file.\n",
    "30.\tAvoid the if(0) or if(true) constructs, it is difficult to find\n",
    "31.\tUse strings and SWITCH as a proxy for enumerated types, it's easy to use, fast and very readable:\n",
    "fruit = 'apple';\n",
    "switch(fruit)\n",
    "  case 'apple'\n",
    "    fun1;\n",
    "  case 'banana'\n",
    "    fun2;\n",
    "end\n",
    "\n",
    "32.\tKeep functions small. They may be re-used by other functions; besides it makes them easier to read and helps keep you organized.\n",
    "33.\tKeep lines short by using the continuation character (ellipsis:  … ).\n",
    "Comments\n",
    "34.\tComments should explain the code and do more than just restate the code.\n",
    "35.\tThere should be a space between the # and the text.\n",
    "36.\tComments should have the same indentation as the statements referred to.\n",
    "37.\tFunction header comments should discuss any special requirements for the input arguments and the format and meaning of output arguments.\n",
    "Avoiding Errors with Proactive Coding Practices\n",
    "38.\tFloating point comparisons should be made with caution. This can cause problems with logical expressions, e.g.\n",
    "shortSide \t= 3; \n",
    "longSide \t= 5; \n",
    "otherSide \t= 4; \n",
    "longSide^2 \t== (shortSide^2 + otherSide^2) \n",
    "ans = \n",
    " \t1 \n",
    "scaleFactor = 0.01; \n",
    "(scaleFactor*longSide)^2 == ((scaleFactor*shortSide)^2 + … \n",
    "                             (scaleFactor*otherSide)^2) \n",
    "ans = \n",
    " \t0\n",
    "39.\tAlways tell sum(), mean(), etc. which direction to go. Even though sum(X) and sum(X,1) do the same thing for matrix X they do different things for a row vector.\n",
    "41.\tVectorize data instead of using loops when possible for improving performance.\n",
