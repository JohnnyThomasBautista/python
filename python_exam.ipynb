    "Recall Quiz 3's dataset - this builds on that dataset further, so the introduction to the dataset is included here as well. The `data` folder contains a file called, `egrid2016.xlsx`. This is the dataset we'll be exploring through these exercises. This dataset is the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) [Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID)](https://www.epa.gov/energy/emissions-generation-resource-integrated-database-egrid) containing information about all power plants in the United States, the amount of genereration they produce, what fuel they use, the location of the plant, and many more quantities. We'll be using a subset of those data.\n",
