    "# Python: Plotting with `matplotlib`\n",
    "[`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/index.html) is a plotting library for Python that builds heavily on NumPy. This package can be used to make publication-quality plots and graphics and is highly customizeable. While `matplotlib` is one of the most well-established Python plotting libraries, there are a number of other plotting packages that you may find useful for your work:\n",
    "- [`Seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/). Creates beautiful plots easily and is built on `matplotlib`\n",
    "- [`plotly`](https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/). Powerful library for interactive plots, which are free for offline use (and there is a paid plan for use on the web).\n",
    "- [`ggplot`](http://ggplot.yhathq.com/). For lovers of R's plotting system, `ggplot2`, this library translates much of that functionality from R to Python. It's based on the \"Grammar of Graphics\" theory of data visualization.\n",
    "- [`Bokeh`](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/). An interactive visualization library that targets the web for presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required Reading\n",
    "Please read the [matplotlib tutorial](https://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html). Another resource that is not required reading, but that you may find helpful is the [plot-specific `matplotlib` tutorials](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html) which provide guidance in terms of how to create specific plot types."
